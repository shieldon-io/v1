### Other Frameworks

Implementing Shieldon on other framework is as easy as well.

```php
// Notice that this directory must be writable.
$writable = __DIR__ . '/../shieldon';

// Initialize Fireall instane.
$firewall = new \Shieldon\Firewall($writable);
$firewall->run();
```
Place this code section in a beginning section of your project.
The beginning section might be the `index.php`<sub>(1)</sub>, `Middleware` or `Parent Controller`.

<sup>(1)</sup> index.php is the entry point for all requests entering your application in most frameworks such as Laravel, CodeIgniter, Slim, WordPress and more.


```php
// Get Firewall instance from Shieldon Container.
$firewall = \Shieldon\Container::get('firewall');

// Get into the Firewall Panel.
$controlPanel = new \Shieldon\FirewallPanel($firewall);
$controlPanel->entry();
```

Put the code on the Controller and the URL that only you know.
Although it has a basic login protection.
